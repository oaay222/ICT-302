#<h1>Hello, I am Olawande Ayeni</h2> 
I love learning about IT and other different forms of technology ranging from hardare to software. I am an arsenal fan which explains why I used the  logo as my page picture. I also love playing different forms of music and I like playing the Piano and drums in my spare time.
Some of my favorite sports to watch are the following:
<ol>
  <li>Basketball</li>
  <li>Soccer</li>
  <li>Football</li>
</ol>
