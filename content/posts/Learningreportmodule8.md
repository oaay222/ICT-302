### On my progress with the "I Can" statements:

I can identify and define key concepts in web content management from what we have been learningin class with markdown, and different kinds of CMS. I can also define and explain why CMS can't be compared to one another and how they all have different purposes and functions. I can describe and compare content management systems like we did in the read and annotate activity in class. I can compare content mn=anagement systems and figure out their different main functions like the ones I explored in the class activity which was mainly used for upcoming businesses who wanted to sell things and get more customers. I can manage content using established workflows like I have been doing with my group for our blog posts and trying to get everyone to turn in their parts on time and just communicating ideas in general with the whole team. I can employ technologies related to content management like I have been doing on WordPress and GitHub with the blog posts and learning reports. I can find and use resources for self-directed learning for example when I am trying to learn how to do something on markdown I look for different ways to do it and from there I learn new things.
