### On my progress with the "I Can" statements:

I can identify and define key concepts in web content management from what I have learned about datatypes and content types this past week. Also I learned how to differentiate between open and closed systems. I can describe and compare content management systems like I read about from Barker's article about Open and Closed content management. He talked about closed CMS's and how they are built around one type of content which could be blop posting or even news. I can manage content using established workflows like I have been doing with the group blog posts and our group projects. I can identify and employ technologies related to content management like using WordPress and Hugo and figuring out what content attributes are being used on a webpage and their datatypes. I can find and use resources for self-directed learning like markdown and learning some html codes.
