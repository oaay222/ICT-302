### On my progress with the "I Can" statements:

I can identify and define key concepts in web content management from what we have learned in class with markdown and different kinds of CMS's. I can define and explain why CMS's are all different and the purposes of markdown. I can describe and compare content management systems like we have been doing in different class activities. I can compare content management systsme and explain their different functions like the ones explored in class acctivities and Wordpress which we use for our group posts. I can manage content using established workflows like we have been doing with our group work and communicating with one another on what part is due when and who is doing what for that week. I can employ technologies related to content management like I have been doing with Wordpress for our group work and on GitHub also. I can find and use resources for self-directed learning like trying different markdowna and html codes to see what the results to out to be.
