### On my progress with the "I Can" statements:

I can identify and define key concepts in web content management like themes and plug-ins.Thmes allow you to change the way the web page look without having to go through a lot of work. Plug-ins allow distribution and installation of other parts of a CMS more accessible to users. Like an extension of the CMS basically and they all work differently. I can compare content management systems like WordPress and Hugo in their similarities they both are used to post content and you can get specific in what kind of content you want to post.
