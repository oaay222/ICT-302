### On my progres with the "I Can" statements:
I can identify and define key concepts in web management like the what we have learned in class with markdow, and content versus presentation. I know how much content and presentation matter and how they are their own things and we have been hammering down on that in our group with what the editors and developers turn in for our posts and project. I can describe and compare content management systems from my experience with WordPress and Hugo. I personally like WordPress a lot and that is just because of how easy it is to navigate around especially for our class website. I can manage content using established workflows like we have been doing in our group where we discuss each person's role and contribution to whatever we have to turn in. It has been going pretty good and we are making good progress so far. I can identify and employ technologies related to content management by using Hugo and WordPress to do assignments and imrpove my tech management. I can find and use resources for self directed learning like the activity where we had to explore WordPress, I dscovered the themes tab and a lof of the different themes have tutorial vidoes and instructions on how they got their website to look how it looks which is a pretty effective way to learn new things.
