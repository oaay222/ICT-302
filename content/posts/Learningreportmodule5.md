### On my progres with the "I Can" statements:
I can identify and define key concepts in web content management from being able to differentiate between content versus presentation. I have learned how both things are seperate but togther they can be the backbone of CMS. I can also compare content management systems and in the class activity where we had to install new themes to our website. This was a pretty cool feature to use because you can take the website to the next level with a different theme and incorporate different elements into the website. I can slo compare different management systems from learning about other github features and using output code. I can manage content using established workflows like I have been doing in class with github and on Microsoft teams. We have been assisting each other and communicating on different ideas with our websites. I can identify and employ technologies related to content management like using Hugo, and github in class to improve my website. I have just recently explored a lot of website themes and I can say that I mastered that part and it was pretty fun trying out different themes. I can find and use resources for self-directed learning like Markdown since we will be using it a lot in this class I have been checking out a lot of themes and trying to see which ones would be compatible with our version of gitbhub.
