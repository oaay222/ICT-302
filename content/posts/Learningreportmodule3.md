On my progress with the "I Can" Statements:
I can identify and define key concepts in web content management from reading articles like the one from Deane Barker on why content management is an emergent skill. A content manager has to have content strategy and the ability to relate content topics, processes, and production to the  mission of the organization. I read a lot about how content modelling has shaped tech world as we know it and how we can apply it to other tech fields. Although we have not really started talking much about  content management systems I have been looking at different kinds and comparing them to each other. One I was reading about is wordpress and I have also read a lot about sharepoint. I am able to manage content through esablished workflows with my group. We have been using the planner app in microsoft teams and using the kanban method which is working pretty good for us so far. I can identify technologies related to content management like different softwares like joomal. I have read about it but I have not been able to get any practice with it yet. I have been finding different resources for self-directed learning as stated above and I am still learning more about markdown because it is something I find interesting and want to learn a lot more about.
