### On my progress with the "I Can" statements:

I can identify and define key concepts in web content mangement like plugins which is basically a type of software that helps increase functionality and is sort of like an added feature to a web browser and this can be used in WordPress. We talked about plugins for our extra group activity for this week and we even had an assignment where we had to find plugins to support the kind of channel we would use for our company. I found a couple of plugins that would support the social media channels I planned on using and found another one that would support posting and embedding YouTube videos to my WordPress website. I can describe and compare content management systems like WordPress and Hugo to find which one fits the type of work I want to do and generally I prefer using WordPress. I can manage content using established workflows like I have been doing with my group all semester and we all try to communicate with one another using microsoft teams. It has been going very well so far and communication has improved. I can identify and employ technologies related to content management  like I have been doing with my group on WordPress and Hugo. I can find and use resources for self-directed learning like finding plugins and trying them out to see if they fit with my WordPress website and my overall goal.
