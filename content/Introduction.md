I love learning about IT and other different forms of technology ranging from hardare to software. I am an arsenal fan which explains why I used the  logo as my page picture. I also love playing different forms of music and I like playing the Piano and drums in my spare time.This is a link to some of the type of music I find pretty interesting as a drummer <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd1X5JWaGgQ" title="drummer"> example link</a>.
