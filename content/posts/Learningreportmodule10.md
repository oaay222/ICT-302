### I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management:
I have been able to identify and define key concepts in web management by understanding the true definition of content and Barker’s definition really helped me understand how everything sort of comes together because when we first started the class I did not know much about it. I can identify and define key concepts in web content management from reading articles like the one from Deane Barker on why content management is an emergent skill. A content manager must have content strategy and the ability to relate content topics, processes, and production to the mission of the organization. During our class period I have been able to read a lot about how content modelling has shaped tech world as we know it and how we can apply it to other tech fields. I know how much content and presentation matter and how they are their own things and we have been discussing that a lot in our group with what the editors and developers turn in for our posts and project. I can describe and compare content management systems from my experience with WordPress and Hugo. I like WordPress a lot because it is easier to navigate around and keep up with progress and what the group is working on. 

### I can describe and compare content management systems:
 I can compare content management systems and in the class activity where we had to discuss about Hugo I learned a lot more about how its features work and how you could also output code which is something I never tried to do but still have interest in learning about other CMS’s. I can compare content management systems due to their different uses and themes. One reason why I like using this is because of the class activity we did where we looked at different CMS’s and figured out their main audience and what kind of CMS it is and the one I was interested in was focused mainly on selling and advertising upcoming products.

### I can manage content using established workflows:
I can manage content using established workflows like we have been doing in our various groups communicating with one another about ideas and work progress. We have been using our established workflows a lot for out group project to communicate ideas and keep track of what everyone is contributing to the group project. 

### I can identify and employ technologies related to content management:
I can identify and employ technologies related to content management like I have been doing on WordPress with the group work and on Hugo with the learning reports for class. I can also identify and employ technologies related to content management like using Hugo, and GitHub in class. An example is when we had to add menus in class to our homepage I almost forgot how to do it so I had to brush up on my experience with GitHub and familiarize myself with the different elements because we do not use it except for learning reports. I personally like WordPress a lot more now that I have learned about it and used it.

### I can find and use resources for self-directed learning:
I can find and use resources for self-directed learning like Markdown since we used it a little bit earlier on in this class I have been trying different codes out and different on the markdown basics page and it has been going pretty well. I have also been finding resources for self-directed learning by trying out different themes and exploring different content management systems.
