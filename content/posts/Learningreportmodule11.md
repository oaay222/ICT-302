### On my progress with the "I Can" statements:

I can identify and define key concepts in web content managemet like content aggregation which is an intentional grouping of content for the purposes of organization or presentation. Another key concept in content management is menuing which means you have a specific “menu” structure, and it links to specified content in the site, regardless of where that content is. I can describe and compare content management systems like hugo, and WordPress and I have become very fond of WordPress because of the easy navigation and the way you can view whatever you are working on in the same window unlike hugo. I can manage  content using established workflows like I have been doing with the rest of my group on our group prjects and weekly blog posts. We try to communicate with one another as much as possible but sometimes workflows can be difficult to manage because group members can be unhelpful at times and it impacts the rest of the group. I can identify and employ technologies related to content management like managing my hugo website and contributing content to the groups blog posts on WordPress. I can find and use resources for self-directed learning for example in our group we usually try to find new things going on in the tech world to discuss on our blog post and we usually learn something new every week because someone else in the group always has some new information to share with the rest of the group.
