### On my progress with the "I Can" statements:

I can identify and define key concepts in web content management like CMS permissions. This is somethinng that me and my group worked on for our extra group project. Basically permissions are like privileges that an owner of a website can give users and sometimes some owners can decide to have no permissions on their website for safety reasons. I can describe and compare content management systems like we have been doing in different class activities. I can compare content management systems and explain their different functions like the ones explored in class acctivities and Wordpress which we use for our group posts. For instance I think WordPress is a lot easier to use than Hugo becuase of how things are arranged and how WordPress does not have to go through Netlify. I can manage content using established workflows like me and my group have been doing so far. Sometimes it is a little difficult communicating with the group but recently everything has been going smoothly. I can identify and employ technologies related to content management like I have been doing with my group on WordPress and Hugo. I can find and use resources for self-directed learning like the plug-ins I have been looking into and trying out. I looked into various ones for video editing and posting on WordPress.
