### On my progres with the "I Can" statements:

I can identify and define key concepts in web management like the what we have learned in class with markdown, and content versus presentation. I know how much content and presentation matter and how they are their own things and we have been discussing that a lot in our group with what the editors and developers turn in for our posts and project. I can describe and compare content management systems from my experience with WordPress and Hugo. I like WordPress a lot becuase it is easier to navigate around and keep up with progess and what the group is working on. I can manage content using established workflows like we have been doing in our various groups coummunicating with one another about ideas and work progress. I can identify and employ tecchnologies related to content management like I have been doing on WordPress with the group work and on Hugo with the learning reports for class. I can also find and use resources for self-directed learning like we do in our groups trying to come up with different topics to write about for our blog posts and learning different ways to make it our presentation look better and aid our content on the posts.
