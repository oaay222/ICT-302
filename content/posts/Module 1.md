In regards to my progress with the "I Can" statements I have been working on my github and mictosoft teams. I have been trying to get acquainted with both of these tools because it my first time diving into this subject area. I am still trying to figure out the hugo tool we will be using in this class and I have some questions about which version to download for this class because on the installation page there are different versions and I was not too sure what specifications came with each version.
